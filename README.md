# Tic-Tac-Toe

1. Tic-Tac-Toe, Julius Audisho
2. I will be building a Tic Tac Toe game. I want to build it because I've always been interested in designing games and learning how the development process works with the use of Java as the programming language. It will be useful for people who wish to exercise their brains as well as people who casually enjoy playing games in their spare time. It will be used to test the player on how well they're able to strategize against an AI for who places their X or O's first vertically, horizontally, or in a straight line.

4. I plan to finish this project before Thanksgiving break ends and will put a great amount effort in creating a quality game that can serve as a test for people who wish to exercise their strategizing skills as well as people who would like to partake in a casual game of Tic-Tac-Toe
