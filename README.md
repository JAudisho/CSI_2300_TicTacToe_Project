# TicTacToe

1. TicTacToe, Julius Audisho
2. I will be building a Tic Tac Toe game. I want to build it because I've always been interested in designing games and learning how the development process works with the use of Java as the programming language. It will be useful for people who wish to exercise their brains as well as people who casually enjoy playing games in their spare time.
