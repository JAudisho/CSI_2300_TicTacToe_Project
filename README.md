My project is about Tic-Tac-Toe, a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. 

To run my program, simply download the TicTacToe.java file below README.md and open it in Visual Studio Code and press CTRL+F5. The output will show empty 3x3 spaces, where the first row is counted as 1-3, second is 4-6, and third is 7-9. By default, the player is "X" and the computer is "O". Enter 1-9 in the terminal to place your "X" in the empty spaces you desire. When the player or computer places their respective letters in a row, column, or a diagonal; they will be declared the winner and you will be given an option to either play again or end the game.

2. I will be building a Tic Tac Toe game. I want to build it because I've always been interested in designing games and learning how the development process works with the use of Java as the programming language. It will be useful for people who wish to exercise their brains as well as people who casually enjoy playing games in their spare time. It will be used to test the player on how well they're able to strategize against an AI for who places their X or O's first vertically, horizontally, or in a straight line.

4. I plan to finish this project before Thanksgiving break ends and will put a great amount effort in creating a quality game that can serve as a test for people who wish to exercise their strategizing skills as well as people who would like to partake in a casual game of Tic-Tac-Toe
